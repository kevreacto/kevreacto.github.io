<h2>History</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a> was founded on April 27, 1865; <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Senate">the New York State (NYS) Senate</a>
    authorized the university as the
    state's land grant institution. Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York, as a site and $500,000 of
    his personal fortune as an initial endowment. Fellow senator and educator Andrew Dickson White agreed to be the
    first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled
    to attract students and faculty.[17] The university was inaugurated on October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled
    the next day.[18]</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Ithaca campus</h3>
<p>Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York, overlooking the city and Cayuga Lake. Since the university
    was founded, it has expanded to about 2,300 acres (9.3 km2), encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding
    areas.[33] Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all of the campus' academic
    buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums. North Campus is composed of ten residence halls[34] that
    primarily house first-year students, although the Townhouse Community occasionally houses transfer students. The
    five main residence halls on West Campus make up the West Campus House System, along with several Gothic-style
    buildings, referred to as "the Gothics".[35] Collegetown contains two upper-level residence halls[36][37] and the
    Schwartz Performing Arts Center amid a mixed-use neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.[38]
    Construction has also begun on two new residential buildings that will be situated on North Campus, providing beds
    for an estimated 800 students, to be completed by fall 2021.[39]</p>
